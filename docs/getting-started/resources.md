# Resources

Before Diving in its a good idea to familiarize yourself with the following technologies if you haven't already. The documentation assumes provides information on things that are hard to find or need deeper explanation.

## FAQs

**At what voltage can I be electrecuted?**

Things are deadly at about 45volts. So circuits running at 5v are safe for the most part.
